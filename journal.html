                    <h2>The First Day At WildCodeSchool!</h2>
                    <p>
                        The September 12th we started our odyssey (just like Homer)
                        towards adventure. In this particular case, we are heading to our
                        destination: knowledge. Becoming a web developer is an exciting journey,
                        where everyday is marked with pride. Indeed, we are not the same as the ones
                        that started three weeks ago (yes, already that long). A self-evaluation is the
                        key to uphold our accumulated knowledge, that grows exponential to our enthusiasm.
                        Onwards, we go!

                    <p>
                        Through error and tries (many of them), we have succussed one
                        workshop after another. GIT, HTML, CSS, lastly: JS. No task is too
                        little for us, the hungry learners of this school! Mastering variables,
                        classes and id‚Äôs, functions and the fearsome media Queries‚Ä¶ Although our
                        last workshop was focused on job finding, as none of this learning process
                        matters if we can‚Äôt find a paid job!

                    <p>
                        The routine in WCS, includes a quizz every week. The highlight of
                        this week wasn't the surprising win of our new student Elif, but
                        the emergence of a new "masked hero" called grumpy cat. Who is he
                        you might ask? We don't know either!

                    <p>
                        The work week culminates in a quiz show with all students, on the Kahoot platform.
                        The instructor, David, details the questions with content that was discussed in the
                        past days prior to the ‚Äúrace‚Äù (as everyone likes to call it). The podium changes
                        little as some students have been as consistent as the same top three spots!
                        But overall, everyone is improving their results, which can only be considered
                        as a success.

                    <h2>Coding Is Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        What is coding? The answer to these questions is still being answered since the
                        beginning of the course, something that goes far beyond the ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù program!
                        The general intent regarding individual objects is more related to ‚ÄúHow to code‚Äù as
                        for all students coding is, above all, a life changing purpose.

                    <p>
                        The ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù word is a concept that perpetuates in everyone‚Äôs minds as a sort of
                        challenge. Indeed, it is most considerable that the students efforts so far have
                        been
                        nothing shorter than advanced, bearing in mind most people are getting into coding
                        for
                        the first time. This next week is full of new challenges, including a new quest
                        (subject) aimed for advanced JavaScript.
